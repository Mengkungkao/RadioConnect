"""Ask MFruit OS to keep this app running after the user leaves it (SDK 1.4.0).

    get()                  -> State(keep_running, screen_bright), or None
    set(keep_running=..., screen_bright=...) -> the new State, or None

``keep_running`` is the app's *Keep running* switch in Settings > Apps:
leaving the app then releases the screen instead of closing it, and MFruit
OS does not stop the process. ``screen_bright`` is *Keep screen bright*:
while the app runs in the background, MFruit OS keeps the backlight at 100%
instead of dimming or turning it off. Use it only when your app needs it, for
example a LoRa radio whose mode pin is the backlight pin (MFruit OS KI-11).
The user can change both in Settings > Apps too; read them with ``get()``
when your app comes back to the foreground.

A background app releases the screen when the user leaves it and stays
quiet: it must not ask for the screen again (docs/apps/APP_CONTRACT.md).

``None`` means MFruit OS is not there (the app runs on its own) or is too old
to answer (before this request existed): treat the feature as unavailable.
The request goes to MFruit OS's control socket and names this app (from
``WHISPLAY_APP_ID``); it is a convenience, not a permission system.
